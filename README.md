# Express Note Taker

  ## Description

  This project was built to allow users to easily save and delete 'notes to self'. The UI for this project was very simple, with the backend functionality being the greater challenge. Using Express.js,  I created a server to handle the functionality of read, writing, and appending the user's notes to a 'notes database' to store them using JSON.stringify() to store the users notes and JSON.parse() to render the saved notes for the user. This project proved especially challenging for me, but by completing it I feel that I have a greater understanding of how servers work to send information between the front and back end.
